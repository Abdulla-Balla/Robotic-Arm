# Robotic Arm Project

This project controls a robotic arm using an Arduino board and five servo motors. Potentiometers are used to control the arm's movements.

## Files

- `robotic_arm.ino`: Arduino sketch controlling the servos based on analog input.

## Hardware Setup

- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- 5 Servo motors connected to pins 9, 10, 11, 5, and 6
- 4 Potentiometers connected to analog inputs A0, A1, A2, and A3

## Usage
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Load `robotic_arm.ino`.
3. Connect your Arduino to your computer.
4. Upload the sketch.
5. Use the potentiometers to control the robotic arm.
